            <h2 class="Name">Hi I'm Tricia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm learning HTML & CSS</li>
                <li>I have 5 kids and 3 step kids</li>
                <li>I love the mountains</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I wanted to share my story about becoming a Techmom! I was a stay at home mom for 11 years. I was
            married to a Tech-guy. We got divorced and it was hard to provide for myself. I tried a lot of
            different entry level jobs and nothing really was a great fit. I didn't feel valued and like I had
            any valuable gifts to contribute to the world.<br></br>
            I found the link to the Techmoms website one day when I was scrolling on a Social Media app. I read
            the website and thought it would be so cool to have a supportive group of women to help me try to
            establish myself in a respectable career and to cheer me on all along the way. I got excited about it.
            Then the voices of doubt came into my mind and told me all of the reasons why it couldn't work out.
            Among them I heard messages like "you have to be there for your kids" and "you don't have what it takes
            to
            have a successful IT career". A lot of messages went through my mind and I was convinced that I would
            not be
            able to do it. <br></br>
            After several days passed, I thought about how happy it made me to think about doing coding and having
            this group of women to support me. I felt like I'd better sign up! So I did. I got more discouraging
            voices
            in
            my head. It took me a lot of prayer and thought work before I just made up my mind and went forward.
            During
            the
            first class I shared my story and it was great. I started to realize that all of the other women were
            just
            like
            me in some way. I wasn't alone trying to figure this world out. I had friends now and people to help me
            learn
            these valuable new skills. It was a journey.<br></br> Through my journey I learned to build a website
            and I
            learned
            to
            believe in myself and I learned that I can do hard things and I don't have to settle for any of the
            beliefs
            or
            lack of belief that anyone had ever given me. There are people who are here to support me with resources
            of
            all
            kinds and I feel hope and joy in my journey of learning!
