    <h2>Hi I'm Tricia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm learning HTML & CSS</li>
        <li>I have 5 kids and 3 step kids</li>
        <li>I love the mountains</li>
        <li>I love dancing</li>
        <li>I create amazing health for myself</li>
        <li>I am a boy mom</li>
        <li>I am a Techmom!</li>
        <p>I wanted to share my story about becoming a Techmom! I was a stay at home mom for 11 years. I was
            married to a Tech-guy. We got divorced and it was hard to provide for myself. I tried a lot of
            different entry level jobs and nothing really was a great fit. I didn't feel valued and like I had
            any valuable gifts to contribute to the world.
            I found the link to the Techmoms website one day when I was scrolling on a Social Media app. I read
            the website and thought it would be so cool to have a supportive group of women to help me try to
            establish myself in a respectable career and to cheer me on all along the way. I got excited about it.
            Then the voices of doubt came into my mind and told me all of the reasons why it couldn't work out.
            Among them I heard messages like "you have to be there for your kids" and "you don't have what it takes to
            have a successful IT career". A lot of messages went through my mind and I was convinced that I would not be
            able to do it.
