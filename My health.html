    <p class="p3"> Over the last twenty years, I have been trying out different dietary guidelines and philosophies.
        I
        have wanted to find a diet that would give me the best health. I have had various symptoms and conditions
        that I have wanted to find a natural way to alleviate. Some of these symptoms have included: hypoglycemia,
        depression, anxiety, bloating, weight gain, stomach pain, infertility and brain fog. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        About 5 years ago I was reading the Medical Medium book series and felt very interested in it. I had
        seen a Foot Zone practioner before that was always trying to give me nutrition advice while she zoned
        my feet. Her advice was from his book "Life Changing Foods". I started juicing celery everyday and I
        remember feeling like it was helping me get through my days better. I had just had a baby several months
        before and I was still recovering. I added in various healing tools- more fruit, more veggies, herbal
        teas, juices, etc. and eventually I did some cleanses. My symptoms were slowly abating! <br>
        <br><br>
        I remember feeling less depressed and less brain foggy. I remember that the rash on my arms was clearing
        up and it had been there for all of my growing up years! That actually took about a year of MM to see that
        change. The longer I did celery juice, and his other detox protocols, the better I felt! Five years later, I
        still feel my best when I'm sticking to his protocols. I have learned a lot from him over the years and
        found
        friends from all over the world who swear by his methods for healing. There are countless celebrities that
        also use his protocols to heal from their symptoms and conditions. Not all of them publicly share about it a
        lot. Anyway, to anyone interested in learning more, I recommend reading his books, watching his videos,
        reading his Instagram posts, and going to his website at <a
