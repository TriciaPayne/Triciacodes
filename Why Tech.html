    <h2> ~ My Story ~ </h2> <br><br><br>
    <div class="story">
        <p>I wanted to share my story about becoming a Techmom! I was a stay at home mom for 11 years.
            I was
            married to a Tech-guy. We had 4 sons together. My husband was a Database Administrator. In 2020,
            we made the decision to get divorced and I had to figure out how to provide for myself. I tried
            a bunch of different Entry-level jobs and nothing really was a great fit. I didn't feel like I was valued
            and while I knew I had valuable gifts to contribute, I could not figure out how to find a lucrative career
            that would utilize my gifts and talents.<br></br>
            About a year after my divorce was finalized, in 2022, I met my current husband, Jason. We eloped to
            Hawaii and got married on the beach! It was a secret wedding in paradise! We started a new life together.
            Jason has 3 kids- Tyler, Kayla, and Lilly. This year I gave birth to a new son, Ryan Michael. I never
            thought I would be the mother or stepmother to so many kids! Lol!<br><br>
            Over the years I have tried doing little side businesses and none of them became successful enough to
            provide me with a reliable income. Last year I was working on a Masters degree in Education and decided
            to put that on hold because I was just too busy to really do that. While I was recovering from having my
            son this year (in 2023), I was one day scrolling a Social Media app and I saw a link to the Techmoms
            website. I thought it sounded interesting and honestly, in the back of my head I used to always try to size
            up
            my
            ex's coworkers and wondering if I could do their job or not- like- was it really that hard? Could I make
            a lucrative career out of tech? Am I smart enough for that? So I read
            the website and I felt excited. I thought it would be so cool to have a supportive group of women to help me
            try
            to
            establish myself in a respectable career and to cheer me on all along the way. I got excited about it.
            <br><br>
            Over the next few days, voices of doubt came into my mind and told me all of the reasons why it couldn't
            work
            out.
            Among them I heard messages like "you have to be there for your kids (and you can't if you do a tech
            career)"
            and "you don't have what it takes" to have a successful IT career". A lot of messages went through my
            mind and I was convinced that I would not be able to do it.

    <div class="p2">
        After several days passed, I thought about how happy it made me to think about doing Techmoms and having
        this group of women to support me. I felt like I'd better sign up! What's the worst that could happen? I
        could learn more about myself and I could see how hard (or easy) it would be for me to learn coding. I
        could meet people and find out what tech women are like. So I did. I got excited and told my husband. He
        was cheering me on! But then, I got more discouraging voices in my head.
        <br>
        After going back and forth on it, I finally got to have my interview and I met Meri. She was so nice and
        she was not some sort of robot! What do you think a Tech-woman is like when you are a Stay at Home Mom for
        so
        many years? Maybe...intimidating in some way. But she was super nice and I still thought all of the other
        Tech-women would be these
        women with super-powers that I couldn't even touch, lol! But they were just real women with real families
        and
        they were just like me it turned out!<br><br>
        During our first class, we introduced ourselves. I shared my story and it was great. I started to realize
        that all of the other women were
        just like me in some way. I wasn't alone trying to figure this world out. I had friends now and people to
        help
        me
        learn these valuable new skills. I learned that I can help other moms too and when I do, it helps me to
        relearn
        what
        I think I know about coding and get better at it. Not only that but my oldest two sons are learning coding
        as
        well
        and now we can do it together and teach each other what we know! It is becoming a thing for us to do
        together as
        well! <br></br>
        Through my journey I am learning how to build a website
        and I
        learned
        to
        believe in myself and I learned that I can do hard things and I don't have to settle for any of the
        beliefs
        or
        lack of belief that anyone had ever given me. There are people who are here to support me with resources
        of
        all
        kinds and I feel hope and joy in my journey of learning!
