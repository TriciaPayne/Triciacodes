            <h4>UI/UX Design</h4> <br>

            <li>I first thought I might like UI/UX Design because I simply googled "tech careers for ENFPs" and that was
                one
                of the 4
                careers that showed up. So I looked into it and decided to buy a course on Udemy and I got started. I
                was
                working hard
                on it day after day when I came across the link to Techmoms and then got started. Soon I was learning
                HTML
                and CSS and
                I felt like I needed to put down the interest that I had in UI/UX for the time because it took all of my
                computer brain
                to try and master HTML and CSS. <br><br>
                In our last class, we had a UX Designer come and speak to us. And I brought my baby that day. My baby
                was
                very fussy
                during her presentation so I didn't hear the first part of her talk. But I gathered from the rest of it
                that
                UX people
                think about how the website is going to flow and work for each person's experience. So that's kind of
                interesting. As I
                think about it now, I think that I am more interested on working on something with deeper meaning and
                deeper
                importance
                than just basic website flow and how stuff works. </li>
            <h4>Front End Software Developer</h4><br>
            <li>Front End Software Developers do the work to make the face of the website work. I kind of liked doing
                this
                work because it involved a lot of creative problem solving, which gave me a bit of a natural high. It
                involved
                learning new things and making things pretty, which I did like okay. It seems like you could make a good
                amount
                of money doing this job.
            </li>
            <h4>Data Science</h4>
            <li>I learned about Data Science at an Adobe event that I got invited to and it reminded me of the
                Statistics
                classes
                that I took in college and hated. The reasoning behind it was super interesting, but the actual actions
                of
                figuring
                out the Statistics was just very hard for me. Is it hard for everyone? Or is my brain just not a
                Statistics
                brain?
                I can do Math, but Statistics is something else entirely!
            </li>
            <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
            <li>What I understand about Full Stack Developers is that they usually work at smaller companies where they
                need one person to do the Software Development work of the Front End and the Back End. I suppose it
                could
                be an interesting task to be able to tackle a lot of different tasks at one company. Perhaps you could
                feel
                quite fulfilled that way. It seems like a lot to take on though. But perhaps the tasks would be more
                bite
                size
                with working at a smaller company or startup. But then you are kind of taking a risk working for them
                because maybe
                they won't be one of the Startups to make it work in the long term.
            </li>
            <h4>Tech Writing</h4>
            <li>Being a natural writer, I thought that maybe this could be my field. And hey, maybe it could be! Maybe I
                could do
                that freelance! I don't know. But writing instructions on techie things sounds kind of boring. Maybe it
                could be a
                good career though, esp. to do as a freelancer work-from-home mom! I really should look into this a
                little
                bit more.
                Maybe there is an introductory course I could take because I can hash out writing stuff if I actually
                care
                what I'm
                writing about quite well!
            </li>
            <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
            <li>Okay, if I'm being honest, this was the Career Path I found most interesting. I guess I just feel really
                passionate
                about keeping people safe with computers. I feel like the alternative is just not knowing if things are
                safe
                or not.
                That doesn't seem like a risk I really want to take. I feel like it could be a really meaningful career
                to
                spend your
                time keeping people safe with their systems and stuff. Would I be good at it? I don't know. Perhaps I
                could.
                But I
                would definitely be passionate about it! So maybe this is a field I should really look into!
            </li>
            <h4> Product Management </h4>
            <li>Alright, so this was the first speaker and she was from Adobe and I actually liked a lot of the stuff
                she
                had
                to say as well. She looks after several different teams, as I understand it, and makes sure the overall
                project
                is moving forward nicely. I'm not sure that I fully understand the difference between project management
                and
                product
                management though. I think product management must mean that they are overseeing the development of a
                product. I think
                project management is someone who is overseeing a whole project and making sure each individual team is
                working together.
                The only reason I can see that I might not go in this direction is because I might decide that I like
                working a bit more
                independently.
            </li>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            I think I would most prefer doing something that is creative like Front-end Software Development or UX
            Design.
            I like that software development has the component of problem solving and that you can just do one
            simple issue
            at a time. It is interesting to me how such small problems can feel like big problems though! I found
            myself getting
            kind of frustrated sometimes and I would have to remind myself that it's usually an easy fix to solve
            problems on
            a website that looks wild and out of control, or just not looking quite the right way it should be.
            There is kind
            of a natural high that goes along with fixing problems. I think you feel like you are unstoppable when
            you are the
            one solving all of the problems. <br>
            With UX Design, I like that there is creativity involved, as well as understanding how people think and
            experience
            a product like a website. So I like that there is a design component as well as presenting ideas and
            brainstorming,
            and then finding solutions that will fit the needs of the company and the client. I know that I like
            working with
            people, being creative, and solving problems.
