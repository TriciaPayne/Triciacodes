            <p>I wanted to share my story about becoming a Techmom! I was a stay at home mom for 11 years.
                I was married to a Tech-guy. We had 4 sons together. My husband was a Database Administrator. In 2020,
                we made the decision to get divorced and I had to figure out how to provide for myself. I tried
                a bunch of different Entry-level jobs and nothing really was a great fit. I didn't feel like I was
                valued and while I knew I had valuable gifts to contribute, I could not figure out how to find a
                lucrative career that would utilize my gifts and talents.<br></br>
                About a year after my divorce was finalized, in 2022, I met my current husband, Jason. We eloped to
                Hawaii and got married on the beach! It was a secret wedding in paradise! We started a new life
                together. Jason has 3 kids- Tyler, Kayla, and Lilly. This year I gave birth to a new son, Ryan Michael.
                I never thought I would be the mother or stepmother to so many kids! Lol!<br><br>
                Over the years I have tried doing little side businesses and none of them became successful enough to
                provide me with a reliable income. Last year I was working on a Masters degree in Education and decided
                to put that on hold because I was just too busy to really do that. While I was recovering from having my
                son this year (in 2023), I was one day scrolling a Social Media app and I saw a link to the Techmoms
                website. I thought it sounded interesting and honestly, in the back of my head I used to always try to
                size up my ex's coworkers and wondering if I could do their job or not- like- was it really that hard?
                Could I make a lucrative career out of tech? Am I smart enough for that? So I read the website and I
                felt excited. I
                thought it would be so cool to have a supportive group of women to
                help me try to establish myself in a respectable career and to cheer me on all along the way. I got
                excited about it.

                Over the next few days, voices of doubt came into my mind and told me all of the reasons why it couldn't
                work out. Among them I heard messages like "you have to be there for your kids (and you can't if you do
                a tech career)" and "you don't have what it takes" to have a successful IT career". A lot of messages
                went
                through my mind and I was convinced that I would not be able to do it.
                After several days passed, I thought about how happy it made me to think about doing Techmoms and having
                this group of women to support me. I felt like I'd better sign up! What's the worst that could happen? I
                could learn more about myself and I could see how hard (or easy) it would be for me to learn coding. I
                could meet people and find out what tech women are like. So I did. I got excited and told my husband. He
                was cheering me on! But then, I got more discouraging voices in my head.

                After going back and forth on it, I finally got to have my interview and I met Meri. She was so nice and
                she was not some sort of robot! What do you think a Tech-woman is like when you are a Stay at Home Mom
                for so many years? Maybe...intimidating in some way. But she was super nice and I still thought all of
                the other Tech-women would be these women with super-powers that I couldn't even touch, lol! But they
                were just real women with real
                families and they were just like me it turned out!

                During our first class, we introduced ourselves. I shared my story and it was great. I started to
                realize that all of the other women were just like me in some way. I wasn't alone trying to figure this
                world out. I had friends now and people
                to help me learn these valuable new skills. I learned that I can help other moms too and when I do, it
                helps me to
                relearn what I think I know about coding and get better at it. Not only that but my oldest two sons are
                learning
                coding as well and now we can do it together and teach each other what we know! It is becoming a thing
                for us to do
                together as well! <br></br>
                Through my journey I am learning how to build a website and I learned to believe in myself and I learned
                that I can do hard things and I don't have to settle for any of the
                beliefs or lack of belief that anyone had ever given me. There are people who are here to support me
                with resources
                of all kinds and I feel hope and joy in my journey of learning!
